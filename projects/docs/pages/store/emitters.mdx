# Emitters

Emitters are fundamental units of communication in the reactive store. They enable straightforward
creation and management of reactive streams, integrating seamlessly with other reactive sources
like emitters, states, and observables. This integration allows you to build complex networks of
streams and effectively manage reactive data flows.
