# Data sources

Data sources act as facades for specific parts of data in external storages like local storage,
session storage, cookies, and more. They implement a unified interface called
<RxLink href="sources/reference/dataSource">DataSource</RxLink>, which simplifies integration with
various storage mechanisms. This interface also enables states to seamlessly connect to external
storages, ensuring that state remains synchronized with them.

## List of Data sources

1. ### [Form Source](/store/reference/formSourceFn)

Bridges Angular form controls with states, providing two-way synchronization between form data
and application state for better maintainability and consistency.

```ts copy
import {FormControl, FormGroup} from '@angular/forms';
import {switchMap} from 'rxjs';
import {state, emitter} from '@bitfiber/rx';
import {formSource} from '@bitfiber/ng/rx';

interface FormValue {
  itemId: number;
  search: string;
}

// Creates a form group
const formGroup = new FormGroup({
  itemId: new FormControl(1, {nonNullable: true}),
  search: new FormControl('', {nonNullable: true}),
});

// Creates a form state synchronized with the form
const formState = state<FormValue>({itemId: 1, search: ''}, s => s
  // Connects the state with the form group.
  // Ensures two-way synchronization between the state and the form group:
  // - Changing the state updates the form group.
  // - Changing the form group updates the state.
  .connect(formSource<FormValue>(formGroup)));

// Creates an emitter for triggering the products loading process
const productsReq = emitter<FormValue>(e => e
  // Reloads products when the form value is updated
  .receive(formState)
  // Defines a side effect for products loading
  .effect(switchMap(data => productsService.get(data))));
```
