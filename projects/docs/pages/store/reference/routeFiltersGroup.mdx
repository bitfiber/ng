# RouteFiltersGroup <Badge type={'class'}>Class</Badge>

Represents a route filters group that facilitates the reactive management of Angular's
form-based filters and links these filters with the route.

The `RouteFiltersGroup` class allows for managing form filters as reactive state that
is synchronized with the current route's query and route params. The filters are represented
as signal state, making it usable in Angular's reactive constructs such as `effect` or
`computed` functions, and other places where signals are typically used.

The properties of the generic types `Q` and `P` can be any type because, before being set to
the route, they are converted to strings using `JSON.stringify`. When filters receive parameters
from the route, they are converted back to their respective types using `JSON.parse`.

This class extends `AbstractGroup` to provide a structured way to organize and manage
the filters state within the Rx store

`@template Q extends Index = object {:ts}`  
The type representing the query params of the route

`@template P extends Index = object {:ts}`  
The type representing the params of the route

## API

```ts copy
class RouteFiltersGroup<Q extends Index = object, P extends Index = object> extends AbstractGroup {
  readonly filters: SignalStateType<Q & P>;
  readonly route: RouteGroup<Q, P>;
  readonly form: FormGroup<FilterControls<Q & P>>;
  constructor(settings: RouteFiltersGroupSettings<Q, P>);
  initialize(): this;
  complete(): void;
}
```

## Example

```ts copy
import {routeFiltersGroup} from '@bitfiber/ng/rx';

// Creates a route filters group
const routeFilters = routeFiltersGroup<{page: number; search: string}>({
  initialQueryParams: {page: 1, search: ''},
});
```
