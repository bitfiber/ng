import {Badge} from '../../../../';

# initialize <Badge type={'method'}>Method</Badge>

Initiates the state.  
In most cases, this method will be called automatically by a group or store managing
the state, so you generally don't need to call it manually unless you have a specific
reason to do so

`@returns this {:ts}`  
The current instance of the store, allowing for method chaining

## API

```ts copy
initialize(): this;
```

## Example

```ts copy
import {signalState} from '@bitfiber/ng/rx';

const data = signalState<number>(10);

// Initialize the state
data.initialize();
```
