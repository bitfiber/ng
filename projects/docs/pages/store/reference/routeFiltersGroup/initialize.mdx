import {Badge} from '../../../../';

# initialize <Badge type={'method'}>Method</Badge>

Initiates the group and all its items.

In most cases, this method will be called automatically by a group or store managing
the group, so you generally don't need to call it manually unless you have a specific
reason to do so

`@returns this {:ts}`  
The instance of the current group, allowing for method chaining

## API

```ts copy
initialize(): this;
```

## Example

```ts copy
import {routeFiltersGroup} from '@bitfiber/ng/rx';

// Creates a route filters group
const routeFilters = routeFiltersGroup<{page: number; search: string}>({
  initialQueryParams: {page: 1, search: ''},
});

// Initializes the group and all items within the group
routeFilters.initialize();
```
