# form <Badge type={'property'}>Property</Badge> <Badge type={'modifier'}>Readonly</Badge>

A `FormGroup` instance that manages the filter controls, where each control corresponds to
either a query param or a route param.

This form group is responsible for handling both user input and programmatic updates.
Changes made in the form controls are automatically reflected in the filters state and
synchronized with the route params, ensuring consistency between the form, filters state,
and the route

## API

```ts copy
readonly form: FormGroup<FilterControls<Q & P>>;
```

## Example

```ts copy
import {routeFiltersGroup} from '@bitfiber/ng/rx';

// Creates a route filters group
const routeFilters = routeFiltersGroup<{page: number; search: string}>({
  initialQueryParams: {page: 1, search: ''},
});

// Updates the form value, triggering changes to the filters state and the route
routeFilters.form.patchValue({search: 'str'});
```
