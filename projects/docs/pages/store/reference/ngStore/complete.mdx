# complete <Badge type={'method'}>Method</Badge>

Completes the store and all of its items, signaling that the store has finished
its operations and is now in a completed state. Once the store is completed,
no further changes or updates will be made to it or its items.
This method is called automatically when the associated component or service is destroyed

## API

```ts copy
complete(): void;
```

## Example

```ts copy
import {Injectable} from '@angular/core';
import {signalState, NgStore} from '@bitfiber/ng/rx';

@Injectable()
class ProductsStore extends NgStore {
  products = signalState<any[]>();
  #ready = this.markAsReady();
}
```

```ts copy
import {Component, inject} from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'bf-products',
  providers: [ProductsStore],
})
export class ProductsComponent {
  readonly store = inject(ProductsStore).initialize();
  
  complete(): void {
    // Completes the store
    this.store.complete();
  }
}
```
