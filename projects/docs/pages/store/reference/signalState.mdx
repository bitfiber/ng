# SignalState <Badge type={'class'}>Class</Badge>

Represents a core data container in the reactive store, responsible for maintaining and
broadcasting data updates to multiple subscribers. Like emitters, the state can create and manage
reactive streams to broadcast changes efficiently. It is designed to simplify state
propagation and synchronization across stores or features, ensuring consistency. The state can
also integrate seamlessly with other reactive sources like emitters, states, and observables.

The signal state provides the same functionality as the <RxLink href="store/reference/state">State</RxLink>.
Additionally, it behaves like an Angular signal, enabling its use in Angular's `effect` and
`computed` functions, as well as in other contexts where signals are typically used

`@template T {:ts}`  
The type of data managed and emitted by the state

## API

```ts copy
class SignalState<T> extends AbstractState<T> {
  readonly $: Observable<T>;
  initialize(): this;
  complete(): void;
  manage(...operators: OperatorFunction<T, T>[]): this;
  get(): T;
  set(value: T): this;
  update(updater: (state: T) => T): this;
  reset(): this;
  compareBy(comparison: Comparison): this;
  connect(source: DataSource<T>): this;
  useLazyEmission(): this;
  useLazyEmissionOnce(): this;
  select<I extends any[]>(...inputs: [...EmitterOrObservableTuple<I>, SpreadFn<I, T>]): this;
  zip<I extends any[]>(...inputs: [...EmitterOrObservableTuple<I>, SpreadFn<I, T>]): this;
  wait<I extends any[]>(...inputs: [...EmitterOrObservableTuple<I>, SpreadFn<I, T>]): this;
  receive(...inputs: EmitterOrObservable<T>[]): this;
  receive<I>(input: EmitterOrObservable<I>, reducer: (value: I, state: T) => T): this;
  transmit(...outputs: (EmitterOrSubject<T> | EmitterOrSubject<void>)[]): this;
  transmit<O>(output: AbstractState<O>, reducer: (value: T, state: O) => O): this;
  transmit<O>(output: EmitterOrSubject<O>, reducer: (value: T) => O): this;
  effect(...operators: OperatorFunction<any, any>[]): this;
  tap(observer: Partial<Observer<T>>): this;
  tap(next: (value: T) => void): this;
}
```

## Example

```ts copy
import {signalState} from '@bitfiber/ng/rx';

// Creates a state
const counter = signalState<number>(1);
```
